Q: Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?
Options: (a) 21 (b) 21.5 (c) 22 (d) 22.5 (e) 23
A: If Q complete x kilometers, then P completes 1.15x kilometers. x + 1.15x = 43 2.15x=43 x = 43/2.15 = 20 Then P will have have walked 1.15*20=23 km. So the answer is (e).

Q: In the coordinate plane, points (x, 1) and (5, y) are on line k. If line k passes through the origin and has slope 1/5, then what are the values of x and y respectively?
Options: (a) 4 and 1 (b) 1 and 5 (c) 5 and 1 (d) 3 and 5 (e) 5 and 3
A: Line k passes through the origin and has slope 1/5 means that its equation is y=1/5*x. Thus: (x, 1)=(5, 1) and (5, y) = (5,1) -->x=5 and y=1. So the answer is (c).

Q: There are k-2 members in a certain band, including Jim and Ellen. Two members are to be selected to attend the Grammy awards ceremony. If there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected, what is the value of k?
Options: (a) 8 (b) 9 (c) 10 (d) 11 (e) 12
A: There are k-2 members in the band, and k-4 members without Jim and Ellen. (k-4)C2 = 6 (k-4)(k-5)/2 = 6 (k-4)(k-5) = 12 = 4*3 k = 8. So the answer is (c).

Q: The speed at which a man can row a boat in still water is 25 kmph. If he rows downstream, where the speed of current is 11 kmph, what time will he take to cover 80 metres?
Options: (a) 18 seconds (b) 27 seconds (c) 26 seconds (d) 12 seconds (e) 8 seconds
A: Speed of the boat downstream = 25 +11 = 36 kmph = 36 * 5/18 = 10 m/s Hence time taken to cover 80 m = 80/10 = 8 seconds. So the answer is (e).

Q: There are k-2 members in a certain band, including Jim and Ellen. Two members are to be selected to attend the Grammy awards ceremony. If there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected, what is the value of k?
Options: (a) 8 (b) 9 (c) 10 (d) 11 (e) 12
A: There are k-2 members in the band, and k-4 members without Jim and Ellen. (k-4)C2 = 6 (k-4)(k-5)/2 = 6 (k-4)(k-5) = 12 = 4*3 k = 8. So the answer is (a).

Options: (a) train (b) tropical seas (c) weather report (d) america (e) caribbean
A: The answer must be a place where because it didn't show up, meteorologists were surprised. A train is irrelevant to the storm and meteorologists.

If the storm didn't show up in the weather report, meteorologists would be surprised when the storm came. So the answer is weather report (c).

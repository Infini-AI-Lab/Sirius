Q: John heard a language that he could not understand. He thought that the door was shut, but he eventually realized that there was no door, and that the light source that was blinding his eyes was very familiar.  He was on his back looking at what?
Options: (a) sky (b) lamp (c) hallway (d) dard (e) closed room
A: The answer must be a place where there are people speaking, no door, and also there is a light source that is intensively strong. lamp is a light source, but not intensively strong, hallway is a place with doors, and closed room also has some doors. Sky is the only place that has no door and a very strong light source, sun, during the day. Also, John can be on his back looking at the sky and hearing people speaking. So the answer is sky (a).

Q: The sun was out and the temperature changing rapidly, it was really beginning to what?
Options: (a) drop to zero (b) increase (c) cool down (d) dropping quickly (e) heat up
A: The answer must be a situation when the sun is out and temperature starts to shift because of the sun rise. The sun rise makes the temperature to go up, and temperature does not drop to zero, does not cool down, and does not drop quickly. Increase is ok but not as clear as heat up. So the answer is heat up (e).

Q: When do girls eat ice cream on the couch?
Options: (a) wash hands (b) were hungry (c) depressed (d) athlete's foot (e) cool down
A: The answer must be a situation when eating ice cream and sitting on the couch help girls feel better. Eating ice cream and sitting on the couch are usually activies that make girls feel comfortable and pleasing. Washing hand is not related to eating ice cream. Being hungry is relevant, but ice cream is usually not the first thing to eat when hungry. Athlete's foot is not relevant to eating ice cream. When girls are cooled down, they won't do things that make them feel better. Feeling depressed is the most relevant among all and a strong reason for them to find ways to feel better by sitting on the couch and eating ice cream. So the answer is depressed (c).

Q: Dan is driving a car, though he's stopped at a light right now. What else can we assume that he's doing?
Options: (a) listening to the radio (b) car crash (c) moving (d) get sleepy (e) going someplace
A: The answer must be a situation that doesn't infer more than the question has given. Dan is driving a car and stopped at a light, which is a common situation when driving. Listening to the radio is a common activity when driving but cannot be infered from Dan's actions. Car crash cannot be infered from Dan's actions. Dan stopped at a light, so he is not moving. Getting sleepy cannot be infered from the question. Going someplace is always right when driving, which is what Dan is doing. So the answer is going someplace (e).

Q: Where could you find a monkey in the wild?
Options: (a) friend's house (b) research laboratory (c) french government (d) beach (e) madagascar
A: The answer must be a place of lots of monkeys in the wild to be found. A friend's house might have pets but not wild monkeys. A research laboratory might have monkeys but not in the wild. French government is irrelevant to finding wild monkeys, and wild monkeys usually cannot be found near the beaches. Madgascar is a place known for wild lives, including monkeys. So the answer is madagascar (e).
